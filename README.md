* **Step 1: Initial assessment and planning**
    * Gather information about the existing legacy application, including the technologies used, architecture, and codebase.
    * Identify the scope and objectives of the project, including the business requirements, target audience, and any constraints or limitations.
    * Define the project timeline and milestones, including the go-live date.
    * Decide as a team how the collaboration and project implementation is going to be managed and implemented Involving:
        * Designers
        * Engineers
        * Product owner | Product manager
    * Set up tools to track progress, issues, and communication within product development.
        * project management tools such Jira, Asama
        * Communication tools such as Slack 
    * Even though, it would be early to worry about these tools since some of them might be needed right before the start of deployment process, but there is a need to setup dev-ops tools based on how engineers work either for continuous integration or continuous delivery or continuous deployment (**CI/CD**).
        * Tools for automating deployment and builds such as 
            * Github Actions
            * Jenkins, 
            * CircleCI
            * Bitbucket Pipelines
            * GitLab CI/CD e.t.c
            * Travis CI 
            * e.t.c
    <br/><br/>    
* **Step 2: Base designing and prototyping**
    * Work with the UX/UI designers to create fundamental wireframes and mockups for the new application. \
Have a Design System to follow in place to help quicken the development process.
    * Iterate on the design with the business team to ensure that the application meets their needs and expectations.  \
If the fundamental layout and architecture is figured out, it would be ideal for the engineers to start working on the product while focusing on the agile methodology for better iteration.
    * Continuously review the prototype with the business team and make any necessary revisions. <br/><br/>    
* **Step 3: Development and testing**
    * Divide the work into smaller tasks and assign them to the appropriate team members.
    * Follow agile development practices, including daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and reviews.
    * The frontend team might need to early work with the backend team to design the API (Either Rest or GraphQL)
        * The good thing about this that the frontend might start implementation by creating a mock-api hence not waiting for the main api to finish \
This makes the development process parallel and fast.
    * Test the application thoroughly at each stage of development to ensure it is stable, user-friendly, and performs well.
    * Collaborate with the back-end team to ensure that the front-end and back-end are properly integrated progressively.<br/><br/>    
* **Step 4: Deployment and improvements**
    * Based on the DevOps CI\CD methodologies in place, execute deployments of the application to the production environment. \
Preferably the deployment can start from 
        * staging (alpha, beta e.t.c)
        * later on production.
    * Monitor the performance and usage of the application in production.
    * If the app is running over multiple microservices it would also be nice to have status pages with tools such as [https://www.atlassian.com/software/statuspage](https://www.atlassian.com/software/statuspage) 
    * For hyper CDN and prevention of DDOS e.t.c one could use \
[https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/)  \
Or  [https://www.cloudflare.com/](https://www.cloudflare.com/) 
    * Fix any issues or bugs that are discovered.
    * Continuously improve and iterate on the application based on user feedback and business needs.<br/><br/>    
* **Step 5: Communication and documentation**
    * Keep all relevant stakeholders informed of the progress and status of the project.
    * Document the design, architecture, and codebase of the new application.
    * Create user guides and documentation for the new application to help users understand its features and functionality.
    * Provide training to users and support staff on the new application as needed.<br/><br/>    
* **Step 6: Migration and transition**
    * Plan and execute the migration of the existing data from the legacy application to the new application. \
You might need to focus on creating scripts from moving the data from one DB to another. \
Putting into consideration aspects like _<span style="text-decoration:underline;">downtime</span>_.
    * Coordinate with the business team to ensure a smooth transition and minimize disruption to users.
    * Test the migration process and fix any issues that arise.
    * Release the new version of the app once the migration is complete.<br/><br/>    
* **Step 7: Continuous improvement**
    * Continuously monitor and measure the performance and usage of the new application. \
AWS has tools to help with monitoring of applications like cloudWatch. \
You can also integrate other monitoring and feedback tools.
    * Gather and analyze user feedback to identify areas for improvement.
    * Implement updates and new features to enhance the functionality and user experience of the application. \
This also includes tracking and fixing bugs.
    * Ensure that the application is maintained and supported in the long term.
